# Zenmaster Avi hasn't taught us how to make actual rspec tests yet,
# but he has explained the theory behind test-driven-development (TDD)
# This file is the foundation of the program; it uses the simplest code
# to scrape the weather from the website I'm scraping.

# The idea here is to make sure the "test" at the bottom of the file passes,
# and continues to pass...if www.weather.com changes their html or URL's, then
# this file will produce and error and I'll know I have to go back & do more work.

# div div main div article #twc-scrollabe table tbody tr td div div span.dsx-date
# the main hours:
# div div main div article #twc-scrollabe table tbody tr td div div span.dsx-date


# It shure would be nice to do this project with a series of arrays and hashes but the
# instructions on the Learn.co website specifically says not to make a collection of hashes
# and I assume arrays are not so great either...so the weather will need to be modeled as an
# object instead.
