# right now this require_all isn't working so I commented it out till I get to fixing it.
# require_all 'lib'

# so I don't know the difference between a "base fork" and a "head fork" so I'm gonna re-push this up and see
# which is which...I'm having no problems sending Red Burd's changes to Blud Burd, but when
# I try & push the newly updated Blue Burd repo to Greed Burd...everything gets screwed up :(


# OK so this time I'm going to try & update Red Burd's repo and then from there update it directly to
# Green Burds repo since that one is the master repo.
